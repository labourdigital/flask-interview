# Interview Task - Data Developer

This is a basic Flask app with some flaws in implementation for a interview coding test. 

The app uses data from a set of donations the Labour Party recieved in January 2022. We'd like to use this data to understand who to target for donations.

Please look through the app and discuss what is wrong with it. Together we will then fix some of the issues, work with the data, and discuss improvements. The goal isnâ€™t to complete everything perfectly but to see how you approach and discuss problems, write code, and explain your thinking.

Feel free to ask questions as you go. You can use any libraries you like - however we ask you not use AI assistants to write code or design your models.

## Tasks

- Identiy problems with `app.py`.
- Refactor the code to fix _some_ of the problems.

## New features

- Add an endpoint to the API that shows the revenue by region.
- Add an endpoint that suggests the next supporter to contact for a donation.
